	<h3>How notifications works?</h3>
	<p>
		PayParrot has to channels to communicate with your server. 
		<h4>Redirections</h4>
		<p> Every time that users generate subscriptions to your service through PayParrot he will be redirected yo a custom URL that you provide us. That URL goes with a POST method with parameters about "subscription_activated" notifications.</p>
		<h4>Server notifications</h4>
		<p> Every time that an action is executed regarding a Parrot, we notify your servers with this informations. There are four types of notifications:
			<ul>
				<li>
					subscription_activated
					<small>When a subscription is activated. POST data also goes with a custom parameter that you defined in the payment button (i.e., your internal user id, or your internal subscription id).</small>
				</li>
				<li>
					payment_success
					<small>Sent each time a payment (tweet) trhough a Parrot's twitter account is made successfully.</small>
				</li>
				<li>
					<small>Sent each time a payment (tweet) trhough a Parrot's twitter account failed (revoked acces).</small>
				</li>
				<li>
					subscription_deactivated
					<small>Sent when a Parrot cancel the subscription to your service, or when more than 3 failed payments ocurred.</small>
				</li>															
			</ul>
